					<h4>What would I expect?</h4>
<p>Firstly, you're the boss. You tailor our meetings to talk about the
things you want to. We will then work together to structure the sessions
 to help you to get where you want to be. Sessions last for 50 minutes.</p>
<p>In the first session, we will need to run through what we should both
 expect at our meetings, this allows us to stay safe. It will also be
necessary to provide some personal details (which will be kept separate
from any other records)&nbsp;and what you want to get from therapy. This
 lets me get to know you. We can go through this together at our first
session, or if you prefer, I can send you a form or two to complete
before you arrive at our initial meeting.</p>
<h4>What do you require from me?</h4>
<p>You simply need to bring yourself and be honest.</p>
<p>In session we can work through techniques and exercises to help you
with your thoughts, feelings and behaviour. You can use these techniques
 on a daily basis. Each time we reconvene, we will review what you
noticed by using these techniques. You will also be encouraged to put
ypur changes into practice between sessions. It is up to you as to how
much of this you wish to do, but by doing so, what have you got to lose?</p>
<h4>Who needs to know?</h4>
<p>What is brought to session is dealt with in confidence. However, this
 confidence cannot extend to matters which may indicate harm to yourself
 or another.</p>
<h4>Where can I find more information?</h4>
<p>Please see the&nbsp;<a href="links.html">useful links page</a>&nbsp;for helpful information or if you have any questions&nbsp;<a href="contact.html">please feel free to contact me</a>.</p>
