				<div class="post">
					<p>Life sometimes presents us with problems. These can cause us to
feel stressed, overwhelmed, worried and confused. We sometimes have
feelings that we don't wish to have. It may be that something isn't
sitting right, but we just can't put a finger on the what the problem
is.</p>
<p>Counselling is a helping relationship; it&nbsp;offers a safe and
confidential space to pay attention to ourselves and our feelings. It
allows us to&nbsp;look at our problems, make meaning of them, and find
helpful ways to cope with them and allow us to feel better.</p>
<h3>Counselling can help you to:-</h3>
<ul>
<li>Identify &amp; achieve your own goals</li>
<li>Make things more like how you want them to be</li>
<li>Manage current problems</li>
<li>Deal with stress</li>
<li>Heal your emotional past</li>
<li>Develop lifeskills</li>
<li>Make decisions</li>
<li>Increase your self-esteem &amp; responsibility</li>
<li>Think &amp; behave more appropriately</li>
<li>Identify repetitive patterns, such as in relationships&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What is Cognitive Behavioural Therapy?</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.beckinstitute.org/what-is-cognitive-behavioral-therapy/">CBT</a>&nbsp;is
 a form of therapy that recognises the relationship between how we
think, how we behave,&nbsp;how we feel and how they relate to one
another. If you don't want to feel the way you do, then you need to
change the thoughts you're having and the things you are doing.</p>
<p>Cognitions: CBT addresses the thoughts that you are having, to see if
 they are unhelpful, untruthful or irrational. It helps you to identify
and break unhelpful thinking patterns. &nbsp;Together with the
therapist,&nbsp;you can work to&nbsp;disregard unhelpful thoughts and
replace them with more rational ones.</p>
<p>Behaviour: Thoughts effect behaviour, and vice versa. We might be in
such deeply embedded habits that we don't even notice this happening.
CBT looks to change those behaviours which aren't helpful to those which
 serve you better. Changing what you do can change what you get!</p>
<p>Changing your thoughts and behaviours can change your feelings.</p>
<h4>Some key points of CBT:</h4>
<ul>
<li>You set your own goals</li>
<li>Sessions are structured to reach those goals</li>
<li>You are also invited to create your own opportunities to reach those goals</li>
<li>Sessions are educational, helping you to become all that you may be</li>
</ul>
